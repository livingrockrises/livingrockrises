### proof of work

Biconomy:
1. [Modular Smart Accounts V2](https://github.com/bcnmy/reflux) -  ERC4337 compatible modular smart account and modules. This played a huge role in adoption of Account Abstraction in it's first year leading to 50+ projects building on top of it, and 2+M deployed smart wallets.  *Solidity*.
##### Deployed contracts:
[Smart Account V2 Implementation](https://contractscan.xyz/contract/0x0000002512019dafb59528b82cb92d3c5d2423ac)
[ECDSA Ownership Module](https://contractscan.xyz/contract/0x0000001c5b32f37f5bea87bdd5374eb2ac54ea8e)
[Session Key Manager](https://contractscan.xyz/contract/0x000002fbffedd9b33f4e7156f2de8d48945e7489)

5. [Biconomy Token](https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-contracts/tree/master/contracts) - ERC20 token with secure access control, upgradeability, meta transactions, and granular configuration. *Solidity*. Deployed over 4 mainnets with total market cap over 350M.
7. [Transaction relayer/bundler](https://github.com/bcnmy/bundler) - Gasless transactions relay and evolved into user operation bundler. *NodeJS*.
8. [meta transactions contracts](https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/tree/master/contracts/6/forwarder) - ERC2771 and EIP712 based meta transactions that allows fee abstraction by sponsorship and ERC20 payment modes. *Solidity*.

Other:
1.  [Smart Account Session Metamask Snap](https://github.com/livingrockrises/snap-auto-approvals) and [Smart Account Keyring Snap] (https://github.com/livingrockrises/snap-account-abstraction-keyring)- Metamask snaps for bringing smart accounts to metamask and showcasing gas abstraction & session. Won the first prize at Metamask snaps hacker house. [ETHBogota '22 Winner](https://medium.com/bitdao/bitdao-metamask-snaps-game7-host-bitdaos-first-ever-sozu-haus-hacker-house-43c4c169fb05).
